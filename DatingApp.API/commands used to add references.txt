enable CORS  ( Cross Origin Resource Sharing)

What is "same origin"?
Two URLs have the same origin if they have identical schemes, hosts, and ports. (RFC 6454)

These two URLs have the same origin:

http://example.com/foo.html
http://example.com/bar.html
These URLs have different origins than the previous two:

http://example.net - Different domain
http://example.com:9000/foo.html - Different port
https://example.com/foo.html - Different scheme
http://www.example.com/foo.html - Different subdomain


Hashing and Salting a password

hashing sha512

1> Hashing a password is a one way process , we take our password and hashes and it scrambles the password and store it in database
  now we need to take into consideration a worst case scenario and that somebody is hacked into our database  and downloaded all usernames and all password hashes and in case of weak passwords it is easy to decrypt
and another downside to this approach of just storing hashes on their own is if somebody uses same password it  gives same hash 
a complex password is difficult to hack

so hashing is definitely good but not good enough on its own , certainly not good enough for weak passwords
so what we also do is in addition to hashing add a salt to the password , salt is randomly generated and added to the password before hashing takes place
so when we add a random salt to a hash it ensures the same password will produce many different hashes and the salt is stored in the database together with the result of the has function and salting a hash
is good for several reasons , first of all it greatly increases the difficulty or cost of pre computed attacks included the rainbow tables we just looked at
salting also make sure at the same password does not result in the same hash

start gitBash 
 1> cd /c/datingApp
 2> 
 Open Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to your local project.

List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.

$ git remote -v
> origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)

Change your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the git remote set-url command.

$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

Verify that the remote URL has changed.

$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)

The next time you git fetch, git pull, or git push to the remote repository, you'll be asked for your GitHub username and password.

If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you must create a personal access token to use instead of your GitHub password.
You can use a credential helper so Git will remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub.

BehaviourSubject
 Is a type of subject (which is a type of Observable)
  Can be subscribed to
  Subscribers can receive updated results
  A subject is an observer(so we can send values to it)

  BehaviourSubject
    Needs an initial value(must always return a value on subscription)
    On subscription returns last value of subject
    can use the getValue() method in non observable code
